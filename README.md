# Scala Native Improvement Proposals

This repository contains the Scala Native Improvement Proposal - a list of Scala Native future improvements, similar to the [Scala Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/scala/improvement-proposals) dedicated to the core Scala-lang.

Currently, Scala Native Improvement Process is not well defined, like [SIPs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips), however, they can be approved or discarded by the Scala Native core team. SNIPs, similarly to [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) can be treated as a form of public discussion to share, comment and review new possible Scala Native improvements, before starting actual work on the given ideas.
